**1. Introduction:**  
Drying clothes outdoors is a common practice, but unpredictable rainfall can lead to extended drying times, unpleasant odors, and hygiene concerns. Manually moving clothes indoors during rain is inconvenient, especially in urban areas with limited space. This project aims to provide an automated solution to protect clothes from rain while ensuring efficient drying.

**2. Objective:**  
To design a motorized system with a water-resistant bellow cover that automatically extends over drying racks upon detecting rain, offering protection and convenience.

**3. Problem Statement:**  
Outdoor drying is widely practiced but faces challenges due to sudden rainfall, leading to:
- Extended drying times and unpleasant odors
- Increased manual effort to move clothes
- Bacterial growth due to moisture retention
- Dependence on electric dryers, increasing energy costs  
A smart, automated rain protection system is essential to address these issues efficiently.

**4. Scope of the Problem:**  
- Outdoor drying is common in urban and rural homes.
- Unattended wet clothes can lead to health hazards.
- High energy consumption of electric dryers impacts costs and the environment.
- Unpredictable rain disrupts daily routines.

| Rain Sensor   | 1       | 100        |
| Wires         | 1       | 200        |
| Bellow Cover  | 1       | 300        |
**Total Estimated Cost:** ₹3000 - ₹3500

**6. Flow of Operations:**  
1. **System Initialization** - Components check and readiness.
2. **Rain Detection** - Sensor continuously monitors precipitation.
3. **Cover Deployment** - Motor extends the bellow cover when rain is detected.
4. **Cover Retraction** - System retracts cover when rain stops.
5. **Monitoring State** - System resets for next cycle.

**7. Comparison with Existing Products:**
